/**
 * The app's colour scheme.
 *
 * Dark, always — and not as a default the system can talk it out of.
 *
 * Both screens exist to show an image: one is a live viewfinder, the other
 * frames a finished photograph. A light chrome around either of those throws
 * light back at the user's eyes in exactly the situation where they are judging
 * exposure and detail, and it tints the picture it surrounds. Every serious
 * camera app is dark for the same reason, and the capture screen here is
 * already pinned to black regardless — so following the system into a light
 * scheme would only ever have produced a light result screen bolted onto a
 * black capture screen.
 *
 * Material You dynamic colour is deliberately off, for the neighbouring reason:
 * it would repaint the interface from the user's wallpaper, which means the two
 * signal colours guided capture is built on — [SphereAccent] for "captured",
 * [SphereActive] for "aim here" — could arrive as two neighbouring pastels with
 * no contrast against each other or against the scene. Those two need to stay
 * exactly as legible as they were designed to be, over an image whose colours
 * are already outside anyone's control.
