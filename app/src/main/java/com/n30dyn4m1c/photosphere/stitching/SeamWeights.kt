/**
 * Which frame paints each pixel, at a reduced "label resolution".
 *
 * The renderer paints one frame per pixel; this is the map that says which. It
 * lives at a fraction of the canvas resolution — every entry covers a `scale`×
 * `scale` block of output pixels — because a seam only needs to be decided to
 * within a few output pixels, and the reduced grid keeps the graph-cut solve
 * and the feathering cheap.
 *
 * [labelMap] holds the winning frame per grid pixel (-1 where nothing covers
 * the sphere). The seam itself is never a hard knife edge: [loserLabel] and
 * [loserWeight] name, for grid pixels within a feather of a boundary, the frame
 * on the other side and how much of it the blend should keep — 0.5 on the
 * boundary itself, ramping to nothing a few pixels away. Everywhere else the
 * winner paints alone at full strength, which is the sharpness seam carving
 * exists for.

/**
 * Turns a solved label map into the narrow seam feather.
 *
 * Each grid pixel gets the *nearest* pixel painted by a different frame and a
 * weight for it that starts at half on the boundary and falls to zero over
 * [halfWidth] pixels — the "fading only a few pixels across the cut" of the
 * README's seam carving. The winner always holds weight 1; only the losing
 * frame's contribution ramps, so the blend inside the feather goes smoothly
 * from one frame to the other and stays pure either side.
 *
 * The scan is deliberately a square window rather than a distance transform:
 * the feather is a few pixels wide, so the O(window) work per pixel over the
 * small label grid is far cheaper than a transform over the full canvas.
