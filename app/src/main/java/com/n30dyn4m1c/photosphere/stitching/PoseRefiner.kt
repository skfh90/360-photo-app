/**
 * Sharpens the measured poses against the image content.
 *
 * The sensor places every frame to within a degree or two, which is good enough
 * for a panorama but leaves the overlaps soft. This pass measures the residual:
 * frames that overlap are matched on ORB features, a pure-rotation RANSAC
 * recovers the *content-observed* relative rotation, and a Gauss–Seidel solve
 * distributes those measurements over the whole pose graph with the sensor
 * rotations as the starting guess. The result is a small per-frame correction on
 * top of the measured pose — the sensor stays the anchor, and the pixels decide
 * the fine alignment.
 *
 * The same correspondences also sharpen the *field of view*. A focal-length
 * error pulls every bearing radially about its optical axis, so the residual
 * the rotations leave behind carries a measure of it; a per-frame focal scale
 * is solved from the matched bearings by least squares ([RotationMath.refineFocalLengths])
 * and handed back with the poses, and the stitcher projects through the
 * corrected focal lengths. Frame 0 is anchored — rotation averaging already
 * fixes it, and the whole sphere may be uniformly scaled without changing any
 * alignment, so the absolute scale is only defined relative to the frame that
 * is held still.
 *
 * Nothing here is allowed to make a stitch *worse*: every edge is checked
 * against the sensor-relative rotation it should be near, frames with no
 * reliable matches keep their sensor pose and their reported focal length, and
 * if nothing matches at all the whole pass hands the sensor rotations straight
 * back.
