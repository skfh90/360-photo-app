/**
 * The sparse per-pixel label data the seam solver works on.
 *
 * Every pixel of the reduced label grid lists the frames that cover it, their
 * colours as sampled from those frames, and the cost of assigning the pixel to
 * each of them. The arrays are packed per node so the whole thing stays flat:
 * node [n] owns `nodeLabelCount[n]` consecutive entries in [nodeLabels],
 * [nodeData] and (three per entry) [nodeColors], starting at
 * `offsets[n]`. [nodeMean] is the mean of the covering colours at each pixel,
 * which is what a frame *not* covering that pixel is said to have recorded
 * there — the fill value that keeps the seam cost a true metric (see
 * [SeamSolver]).

/**
 * The multi-label seam solver: assigns every canvas pixel to exactly one frame.
 *
 * Where the renderer's cross-fade lets every overlapping frame contribute to a
 * pixel, seam carving asks which single frame should paint it and cuts there,
 * reserving the blend for a few pixels either side of the cut. The assignment
 * is the minimizer of an energy over the label grid:
 *
 * ```
 * E(f) = Σ_p D(p, f(p))  +  Σ_{edges (p,q)} λ · ( |I_fp(p) − I_fq(p)| + |I_fp(q) − I_fq(q)| )
 * ```
 *
 * The data term `D(p, i)` says how far frame i's sample sits from the mean of
 * every frame covering p — the frame closest to what the overlap actually
 * shows wins the interior. The edge term is the *seam cost*: cutting between
 * pixels p and q with different frames costs how differently the two frames
 * see p and q, so a cut through a region where the frames agree is cheap and a
 * cut through a ghost is expensive. `λ` scales the two against each other.
 *
 * The energy is minimized with α-expansion (Boykov–Veksler–Zabih): each label
 * in turn offers every pixel the move "keep your frame, or switch to this one",
 * and the binary subproblem is an s-t min-cut on the pixel grid. The smoothness
 * term is a metric — the colour difference at a pixel between any two labels is
 * a Euclidean distance, with a frame that does not cover the pixel filled by
 * that pixel's mean colour, and the sum over two endpoints of two metrics is a
 * metric — so every expansion move is submodular and its exact min-cut can
 * never raise the energy. A couple of passes over the labels converge to a
 * local minimum that is typically global for the small label sets a capture
 * produces.
 *
 * Everything here is plain Kotlin with no OpenCV, so the whole solver is
 * exercised by JVM unit tests against an exhaustive search on tiny grids.
