/**
 * The seam-carving front end: decides which frame paints each output pixel.
 *
 * The renderer's cross-fade lets every overlapping frame contribute to a pixel,
 * which is what softens detail along the seams. Seam carving instead asks the
 * graph-cut in [SeamSolver] to assign each pixel to the single frame that
 * agrees best with its neighbours, then paints with a near-hard selection that
 * only cross-fades a few pixels across each cut — see [SeamWeights] and
 * [SeamFeather].
 *
 * The assignment is decided at a reduced resolution ([LABEL_GRID_WIDTH] across
 * the canvas), for three reasons. A seam only needs to be located to within a
 * few output pixels, so the solve can run on a grid a fraction of the size; the
 * graph-cut's cost scales with that grid rather than with the full canvas; and
 * the feather is then computed where it is wide enough to matter. Each grid
 * pixel's direction is projected back into every frame through the same lens
 * model the renderer samples through, the sample's colour is read from the
 * frame's pixels, and the [PackedGrid] the solver needs is built directly.
 *
 * This file is the only OpenCV-dependent part of seam carving; [SeamSolver],
 * [SeamWeights] and [SeamFeather] are pure Kotlin and JVM-tested.
