/**
 * Turns a session's frames into one equirectangular sphere.
 *
 * **Why this is not OpenCV's `Stitcher`.** It cannot be: the stitching module is
 * absent from every prebuilt OpenCV for Android. `org.opencv:opencv` ships Java
 * bindings for core, imgproc, features2d, calib3d and the rest, but there is no
 * `org.opencv.stitching` package and `libopencv_java4.so` contains none of the
 * pipeline's symbols either. `cv::Stitcher` is, in practice, a desktop API.
 *
 * **What replaces it.** Guided capture already knows where the camera was
 * pointing for every frame, because the alignment gate only fires when the
 * device is held on a known target. That turns the hard half of stitching —
 * solving for each camera's rotation — into something already measured, and what
 * is left is a reprojection: every pixel of the output canvas is a direction on
 * the sphere, and for each frame that direction is rotated into the frame's axes
 * and divided through by depth to find the pixel that saw it. Overlaps are
 * resolved by multi-band blending (see [MultibandBlender]): every frame and its
 * feather mask are split into Laplacian/Gaussian pyramids and each band is
 * cross-faded with a mask sized to the band, so a seam is faded at every scale
 * by a transition narrower than the detail that scale carries.
 *
 * The measured poses are not the last word. [PoseRefiner] matches ORB features
 * between overlapping frames and solves for a small per-frame correction on top
 * of the sensor pose — the sensor stays the starting guess and the fallback, and
 * the image content decides the fine alignment. The same matches also refine
 * the field of view: a per-frame focal scale is solved from the matched
 * bearings, so the last bit of scale error a loosely-described lens leaves
 * behind is absorbed before rendering (see [PoseRefiner]). The lens's radial
 * distortion is carried through the whole model (see [RadialDistortion]) so
 * frame edges, where seams live, land where the lens really put them, and
 * [ExposureCompensation] equalises per-frame brightness so the blends do not
 * show seams of light.
 *
 * The result is equirectangular *by construction* rather than by cropping
 * something else into shape: a pixel's row *is* its latitude, so an incomplete
 * sphere is black exactly where it was not shot, at the right elevation.
 *
 * Everything runs on [Dispatchers.Default] — it is compute-bound — and failures
 * come back as a failed [Result] holding a [StitchException]. A sphere that was
 * captured too sparsely is an ordinary outcome of a hurried run, not a crash.

     * instead of a 2:1 image with black wedges at the poles.

     * The two field of view angles describe the *decoded, upright* frame — the
     * same screen-frame angles `rememberSphereOptics` reports — and set how
     * much sphere each frame is taken to cover. Getting them wrong scales the
     * whole panorama: too narrow leaves gaps between frames, too wide overlaps
     * them.
     *
     * [radialDistortion], when the optics reported one, carries the lens's
     * Brown-Conrady coefficients through the projection so frame edges land
     * where the lens put them.
     *
     * [unsharpAmount] (0 = off) is the strength of a masked unsharp mask
     * applied to the finished canvas — the perceived crispness of the output.
     *
     * [pivot] says how far the lens sat from the axis the capture was turned
     * about. The default treats the two as the same point, which is what a
     * tripod gives; a hand-held sphere shot by swivelling on the spot wants
     * [PivotModel.HandheldBodySwivel].
     *
     * [portraitRotationDegrees] is the clockwise turn that makes a raw
     * (sensor-native) frame display-upright at the current display rotation —
     * the rotation CameraX records in each still's EXIF `ORIENTATION` tag. When
     * a frame's tag is missing or was lost in a metadata rewrite, the frame
     * decodes in the sensor's native orientation, transposed against the
     * portrait pose; it is rotated by this amount so its content still lands
     * upright on the sphere.
     *
     * [useRefinement] opts into feature-based pose refinement. It defaults to
     * off: the measured poses are accurate enough to stitch on their own, and
     * refinement can move frames off them when the scene has parallax — a
     * body-swivel capture of a close scene breaks the pure-rotation feature
     * model the refinement assumes. Pass true to let image content correct the
     * measured poses where the features agree.
     *
     * [useSeams] opts into seam carving: instead of the wide cross-fade, every
     * pixel is painted by the single frame the graph-cut [SeamFinder] assigns
     * it, and only a few pixels across each cut blend the loser in — sharper
     * overlaps at the price of a little compute and a seam that is only as
     * good as the frames agree.
     *
     * [onProgress] is called from the stitching thread, not the main one — hand
     * the value to a `StateFlow` or post it rather than writing Compose state
     * from it directly.
