/**
 * Paints frames onto an equirectangular canvas.
 *
 * Each output pixel is a direction on the sphere. For every frame that can see
 * that direction, the direction is rotated into the frame's own axes and divided
 * through by depth, which gives the pixel of the frame that looked at it — the
 * inverse of the projection the lens performed. `remap` then does the sampling.
 *
 * Where frames overlap, the result is a multi-band blend rather than whichever
 * frame was painted last. The feather weight becomes each frame's mask, and the
 * mask and the frame are each split into a Laplacian/Gaussian pyramid: fine
 * detail is faded across a narrow cross-fade, broad illumination across a wide
 * one, so a seam that survives one band does not survive the one that carried
 * it. See [MultibandBlender] for the maths.
 *
 * With a [SeamWeights] assignment the per-pixel feather is replaced by the seam
 * weights: the winning frame of each pixel contributes at full strength and
 * every other frame contributes nothing, except for a few pixels either side of
 * each cut where the loser's contribution ramps in — seam carving, with the
 * multi-band machinery left to handle the narrow transition. Outside an overlap
 * the weights are still all on one frame, so single-coverage detail comes
 * through untouched either way. See [SeamFinder].
 *
 * **Memory.** A 4096-wide canvas needs 100 MB of float accumulator if it is
 * held all at once, which is exactly the kind of allocation that ends a stitch
 * on a mid-range phone. Every level is therefore built in horizontal bands:
 * only the band being accumulated exists in float, and each frame contributes
 * through the intersection of the band with its own footprint. The coarser
 * levels, which carry the wide cross-fade, live in mats a fraction of the
 * canvas. The total work is unchanged — every frame still touches each of its
 * pixels once at every level — but the peak is tens of megabytes rather than a
 * hundred.

     *
     * [pivotRatio] is [PivotModel.ratio]: how far the lens sat from the axis the
     * user turned about, as a fraction of the scene's distance. Zero treats the
     * lens as the pivot, which is what a tripod gives and what a hand-held
     * capture never quite does.
     *
     * [seams], when given, switches the overlaps from the wide cross-fade to the
     * seam-carved assignment (see [SeamWeights]): each pixel is painted by one
     * frame at full strength, and only a few pixels across each cut blend the
     * loser in. Without it the render behaves exactly as before.
     *
     * The four span/centre numbers describe the region of the sphere the canvas
     * holds (see [Equirectangular]); they default to a full 360°×180° sphere.
     * The canvas is expected to be sized to them — `canvasHeight` should be
     * `canvasWidth * latitudeSpan / longitudeSpan` for square pixels.
