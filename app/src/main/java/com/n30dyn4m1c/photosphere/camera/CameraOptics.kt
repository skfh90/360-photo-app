/**
 * Derives the on-screen field of view from the camera's optics.

 * Two independent estimates are made and then reconciled, because either one
 * alone will quietly mislead on some phone:
 *
 * - **From the calibration.** `LENS_INTRINSIC_CALIBRATION` reports the focal
 *   length in pixels, which with the array it is quoted against gives the exact
 *   angle each edge subtends. It is quoted against the *pre-correction* active
 *   array, not the plain active array — using the wrong one is a small error,
 *   and using an array from a different sensor mode is a factor-of-two one.
 * - **From the geometry.** Physical sensor size over focal length. Coarser, but
 *   it cannot be quoted against the wrong crop, which makes it the tie-breaker.
 *
 * If they disagree by more than [MAX_ESTIMATE_DISAGREEMENT] the calibration is
 * discarded. That check is the whole point of doing the work twice: a field of
 * view overestimated by a third spaces the capture plan a third too wide, and
 * the first sign of it is a run that will not stitch.
 *
 * Picking the focal length is its own trap on a logical multi-camera, which
 * lists one per physical lens. Taking whichever comes first can hand back the
 * ultrawide's 2.2 mm while the session streams the main lens — a field of view
 * nearly twice the truth, targets spaced nearly twice too far apart, and frames
 * that do not overlap at all. [selectFocalLengthMm] picks by what the profile
 * asked for instead.
 *
 * Two corrections then land the result on the screen: the stream's aspect ratio
 * crops the sensor's angles down to what is really being read out, and the
 * sensor's mounting rotation relative to the display decides which of the two
 * runs across the viewport. The preview's `FILL_CENTER` scaling is handled
 * downstream by [SphereProjection.focalLengthPx], which takes the field of view
 * as the *uncropped* maximum.
 *
 * The same query also reads `LENS_DISTORTION` (API 28+), the lens's Brown-Conrady
 * coefficients at the active-array scale, so the stitcher can straighten frame
 * edges instead of treating the lens as a pinhole.
