 * dwell is what stops a frame being taken while the phone is still swinging
 * through the target: at a walking pan rate the reticle crosses a 2° window in
 * well under 300 ms, so only a deliberate stop fires the shutter. Any sample
 * outside the threshold clears the timer — there is no leniency, because a
 * frame captured mid-swing is a blurred frame the stitcher has to reject later.
 *
 * The caller supplies the clock, which keeps this pure and testable; use a
 * monotonic source such as `SystemClock.elapsedRealtime()` in production so a
 * wall-clock adjustment cannot fire the shutter.
