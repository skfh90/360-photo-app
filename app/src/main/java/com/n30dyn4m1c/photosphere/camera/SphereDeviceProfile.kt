 * Per-device tuning, decided once per phone.

 * The generic defaults suit a mid-range device; this profile is the single
 * place a specific phone is tuned. It picks which lens to capture with, caps
 * the still-capture size to what the stitch can actually use, sets how many
 * frames each target is burst before the sharpest is kept, and decides how
 * much resolution and sharpening the stitch ends with.
 *
 * The device detection keys off the model, so a new flagship is a few lines
 * here rather than a sprinkling of `if (Build.MODEL == …)` across the camera
 * and stitching code.

         *
         * - **The 50 MP main is the capture lens** ([preferWidestCamera] is
         *   false). It is the sharpest camera on the phone — better glass, OIS,
         *   and a much larger sensor than the ultrawide — so a sphere on the
         *   main is notably crisper even at the same output size. It costs more
         *   frames (~33 instead of ~11), which is the price of sharpness.
         * - **Stills are capped at the 12 MP binned output**, which writes fast
         *   and is far more than the stitch reads; 50 MP stills would only slow
         *   the burst.
         * - **The stitch runs at 2000 → 6144.** Frames are decoded at a 2000 px
         *   long edge and the sphere is rendered up to 6144 wide (Google's
         *   Photo Sphere standard is 5376), so the main camera's detail reaches
         *   the finished photo instead of being thrown away at 4096.
         * - **Burst three and sharpen lightly.** Three frames per target make a
         *   sharp survivor more likely, and a gentle unsharp mask lifts the
         *   finished canvas without haloing the parts of the sphere that were
         *   never shot.
