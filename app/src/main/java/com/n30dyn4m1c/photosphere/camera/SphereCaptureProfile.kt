/**
 * How one sphere is captured, decided once per device.
 *
 * A photosphere's seams are exposure and colour seams: if every frame re-runs
 * the camera's auto-exposure and auto-white-balance on its own, three frames of
 * a room and one of a window come back in three different brightnesses and
 * colour temperatures, and no amount of blending can hide that. So the session
 * holds them all — AE lock pins the ISO and shutter speed the HAL converged on
 * when the preview started, AWB lock pins the colour temperature, and focus is
 * locked on the scene (by tap, or the first scene's centre) so nothing
 * re-focuses mid-sweep. This is the same model GCam's Photosphere uses: lock
 * exposure and focus, then sweep.
 *
 * The one rule the locks observe: they are applied only *after* the 3A has
 * converged on the scene the phone is pointed at. Locking from the stream's
 * first frame pins the exposure at the HAL's stream-start defaults — a short
 * exposure and low ISO chosen for a bright scene — which leaves a dark scene
 * permanently black: the viewfinder never brightens and every frame records a
 * black image. The session starts unlocked, waits for AE/AWB to converge (the
 * exposure ramps up over the first moments in low light), and locks to the
 * values they settled on. See [applyStillImageOptions] and
 * PhotoSphereCameraScreen's convergence callback.
 *
 * The one thing that varies per device is *how* focus is fixed:
 *
 * - [FocusMode.FOCUS_POINT] — the default for any lens that can focus. The
 *   session runs `AF_MODE_AUTO`, and the user taps the viewfinder to aim focus
 *   at a scene region; the sweep converges there and the lens holds that
 *   distance for the rest of the session, exactly like a regular camera's
 *   tap-to-focus lock. Until the first tap the lens holds the centre of the
 *   first scene it saw. This is what keeps frames sharp: focus is *locked on
 *   what the scene actually is* rather than parked at infinity, which reads as
 *   blur on any scene with something nearer than the horizon.
 * - [FocusMode.FIXED_FOCUS] — the lens physically has no focus mechanism
 *   (`LENS_INFO_MINIMUM_FOCUS_DISTANCE` is 0); `AF_MODE_OFF` is all there is.
